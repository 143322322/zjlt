enterprises cannot demonstrate their credit worthiness, hence making it difficult to carry
out self-compensated trade financing. The financial needs of enterprises can be met
only through the traditional pledge or supply chain financing model, which is a great
obstacle for social progress and the rational allocation of social resources. The root
causes of the industry pain points, i.e. difficulty in obtaining financing are because the
enterprise credit cannot be self-certified, cannot accumulate, and cannot be rated.

reform of supply chain finance, and even the whole financial industry
